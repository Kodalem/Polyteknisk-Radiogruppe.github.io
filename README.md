# Christine's Notes!

## Pre-requisites

***You must get the .json key file from the Google Cloud Platform to be able to run the project.***

Follow the instructions in the [Litestream Documentation](https://litestream.io/guides/gcs/). The key file should be in the own
created `./private/this_must_be_moved` folder. And make sure that Dockerfile has the correct path to the key file, i.e. 
`./private/this_must_be_moved/your_key_file.json`.

## Building

```zsh
docker build -t tiny-stack-2 .
```

## Running 

```zsh
docker run \
  -p 4321:4321 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  tiny-stack-2
```
